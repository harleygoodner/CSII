#Discription: This code allows a user to play a simple game of battleship against the computer. The game lasts 10 rounds and if either player successfully sinks all four of the opponent's ships, they win and the game ends. The user places their ships wherever on the 5x5 board, and the computer randomly places their ships on their 5x5 board.
